How to use:


**How much was AI used?**

* I used AI a lot to help me think and explain things. Having a full understanding was the most important thing for me.

* I also used it to generate boilerplate code and sometimes some complex things.

* I used AI to generate instructions for me to follow. Since I didn't want AI to do everything for me, I wrote most of the
code by myself, because this project has also helped me learn. I didn't trust it blindly, but I reviewed everything and
basically used it as an extension to my previous knowledge.

* I used ChatGPT and Copilot. I had multiple tabs of copilot open to ask any new questions that came up, which helped a lot
in understanding.
